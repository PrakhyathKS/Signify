# Signify_Voice-To-2D-Sign

This model is developed to facilitate communication between normal users and deaf users, functioning as follows:

- The spoken word by the normal user is checked against the database.
- If the word is present in the database, the corresponding 2D sign is displayed in the user interface.
- If the word is not found in the database, it is split into single letters and displayed as 2D signs for the deaf user.
